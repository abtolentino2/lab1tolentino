			<h3>Anzel Clarenz Tolentino - BSIT- MI181</>
		</div>
		<div align = "center">Hello! I am Anzel Clarenz Tolentino, student from Asia Pacific College. 
Originally from the city of Pasay. Graduated Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics strand on
Senior High School also in Asia Pacific College. My capabilities as a student is not the high caliber type, mainly because
I mostly do what I want to do other than having a fully academical mindset. Some would say that it's mediocre and irresponsible but I disagree,
because I know my limitations and I always believed that it's always important to be balanced. 
By balanced I mean it always depends of which environment I am with. If I was in home I would prioritize my family, If I was around my friend obviously I would socialize
and if I was in school then I would think academically. 
Choosing IT course is one of my biggest risk. Given that my interest in technology is highly curious, Information Technology course is one of the most difficult but in demand in the society, 
by the reason of feeding my curiousity and seeking opportunity I took the biggest risk of my life and now I may be struggling but I know it would be worth it.

In terms of personal life. I do nothing much as a hobby, I'm not sporty despite my physical potential, therefore I'm more likely in front of the computer to entertain myself. Sometimes I read fictional books
when there are no internet or electricity because I like to imagine things out of the words I've red. It's pretty boring to know what I was doing for entertainment but I'm contended on everything that I do.
